# Stock-Price-Simulation
Monte carlo simulation of a given Stock. 

This simulation uses Geometric Brownian motion to model stock prices in the Black-Scholes Model. It takes real stock data from Yahoo finance and can simulate any stock data for any given time period, any number of times.

It plots the Probability Density function and computes the probability the stock has increased or decreased in the chosen time frame.
